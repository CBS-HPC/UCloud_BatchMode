# UCloud Tutorial: Batch Processing on UCloud

Running non-interactive script in "batch mode" can help overcome the UCloud capacity issues as jobs can be started any time and then executed whenever the systems resources permits.  

Many applications already have a "Batch Processing" UCloud functionality:

- [Batch Processing](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/Apps/batch_apps.html)
- [RStudio](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/Apps/rstudio.html?highlight=rstudio)
- [JupyterLab](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/Apps/jupyter-lab.html?highlight=jupyterlab)
- [Matlab](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/Apps/matlab.html?highlight=matlab)
 
Application that currently does not have this UCloud functionality (e.g. Stata) can instead run batch mode computations using the terminal app. See the following tutorials:
